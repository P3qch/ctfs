we want x to be some function (probs win)
binary is no-pie so we can just take the address of win (0x4011a0)
once again there is an overflow of buf, its size has been rounded to 16 (because that's how it works) 
and after that we have 16 bytes of heap metadata of the next chunk (x in this case) after which come the contents of x
